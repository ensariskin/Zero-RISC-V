# Pipeline Hazard Management

This directory contains comprehensive hazard detection and resolution mechanisms for the RISC-V pipeline processor. These components ensure correct instruction execution despite pipeline dependencies and resource conflicts.

## Module Components

### Data_Forward.v

Data forwarding unit implementing hardware-based hazard resolution:
- Read-after-write (RAW) hazard detection across pipeline stages
- Automatic result forwarding from later to earlier stages
- Priority-based forwarding path selection
- Operand multiplexer control for execution stage
- Support for multiple concurrent forwarding operations
- Forwarding path coverage:
  - Memory stage to Execute stage forwarding
  - Write-back stage to Execute stage forwarding

### Hazard_Detection.v

Hazard detection unit providing comprehensive pipeline hazard identification:
- Load-use hazard detection and stall insertion
- Structural hazard identification and resolution
- Control hazard coordination with branch prediction
- Pipeline bubble generation for hazard mitigation
- Stall signal generation for pipeline stage coordination
- Exception and interrupt hazard handling support

## Hazard Resolution Mechanisms

### Data Forwarding Operation

The data forwarding unit operates through the following process:

1. **Dependency Analysis**: Continuous monitoring of register addresses across pipeline stages
2. **Conflict Detection**: Identification of read-after-write dependencies
3. **Forwarding Path Selection**: Determination of appropriate forwarding source
4. **Multiplexer Control**: Generation of control signals for operand selection
5. **Priority Resolution**: Handling of multiple simultaneous forwarding requirements

### Hazard Detection Process

The hazard detection unit implements:

1. **Load-Use Detection**: Identification of immediate load result dependencies
2. **Stall Signal Generation**: Pipeline stall control for unresolvable hazards
3. **Bubble Insertion**: NOP injection for pipeline timing correction
4. **Stage Coordination**: Synchronization of stall signals across pipeline stages
5. **Recovery Management**: Pipeline restart after hazard resolution

## Forwarding Path Configuration

### Forward from Memory Stage
- **Source**: Memory access stage result output
- **Destination**: Execute stage operand inputs
- **Control**: Register address comparison logic
- **Priority**: Higher priority over write-back forwarding

### Forward from Write-Back Stage  
- **Source**: Write-back stage result output
- **Destination**: Execute stage operand inputs
- **Control**: Register address comparison logic
- **Priority**: Lower priority than memory stage forwarding

## Hazard Type Coverage

The hazard management system addresses:

- **Data Hazards**: Read-after-write dependencies between instructions
- **Load-Use Hazards**: Immediate use of load instruction results
- **Control Hazards**: Branch and jump instruction pipeline disruption
- **Structural Hazards**: Resource conflict prevention and management

## Performance Impact

Hazard management mechanisms are optimized for:

- **Minimal Stall Frequency**: Maximum utilization of data forwarding
- **Fast Hazard Detection**: Single-cycle hazard identification
- **Efficient Recovery**: Rapid pipeline restart after stall periods
- **Forwarding Priority**: Intelligent forwarding path selection for optimal performance
