# Pipeline Register Implementation

The pipeline registers provide temporal storage between pipeline stages, maintaining data and control signal integrity throughout the 5-stage processor pipeline. These registers enable pipelined operation and support hazard management mechanisms.

## Register Components

### IF_ID.v

Instruction Fetch to Instruction Decode pipeline register featuring:
- 32-bit instruction word storage from fetch stage
- Program counter plus four (PC+4) value preservation
- Immediate value storage from early decode logic
- Branch prediction state maintenance
- Pipeline flush capability for branch misprediction recovery
- Stall signal support for hazard management

### ID_EX.v

Instruction Decode to Execute pipeline register providing:
- Dual operand storage (A and B register values)
- Complete control signal preservation for subsequent stages
- Immediate value and PC+4 storage for address calculations
- Branch type and prediction information maintenance
- Register address forwarding for hazard detection
- Pipeline flush and stall control support

### EX_MEM.v

Execute to Memory Access pipeline register implementing:
- ALU computation result storage
- Store data preservation for memory write operations
- Memory access control signal maintenance
- PC+4 value storage for jump and link operations
- Register write control signal forwarding
- Branch resolution and correction signal handling

### MEM_WB.v

Memory Access to Write-Back pipeline register featuring:
- ALU result and memory load data storage
- Write-back control signal preservation
- Destination register address maintenance
- PC+4 value storage for link register operations
- Register write enable signal forwarding
- Final stage control signal management

## Pipeline Register Operation

Pipeline registers execute the following functions each clock cycle:

1. **Data Capture**: Synchronous capture of input signals on clock edge
2. **Signal Preservation**: Maintenance of captured values until next clock cycle
3. **Control Propagation**: Forward control signals to subsequent pipeline stages
4. **Hazard Support**: Enable stall and flush operations for hazard management
5. **Reset Handling**: Asynchronous reset capability for initialization

## Pipeline Control Mechanisms

### Stall Control
- **Pipeline Bubble Insertion**: Support for load-use hazard stalls
- **Multi-Cycle Operation**: Accommodation of memory access delays
- **Dependency Resolution**: Coordination with hazard detection units

### Flush Control
- **Branch Misprediction Recovery**: Clearing of incorrect speculative instructions
- **Exception Handling**: Pipeline state restoration capabilities
- **Control Flow Correction**: Rapid pipeline state correction

## Signal Categories

The pipeline registers manage several signal categories:

- **Data Signals**: Instruction words, operand values, computation results
- **Address Signals**: Program counter values, memory addresses, register addresses
- **Control Signals**: ALU operations, memory controls, register write enables
- **Status Signals**: Branch predictions, hazard indicators, exception flags

## Implementation Characteristics

Pipeline registers are designed with:

- **Synchronous Operation**: Single clock domain throughout pipeline
- **Minimal Propagation Delay**: Optimized for high-frequency operation
- **Robust Reset Behavior**: Reliable initialization and error recovery
- **Synthesis Optimization**: Efficient FPGA and ASIC implementation
- **Timing Closure**: Balanced pipeline stage delays for maximum frequency
