# RV32I Processor Development Changelog
## July 2, 2025

## Summary
This changelog documents the completion of RISC-V verification environment setup and pipeline architecture refactoring for the RV32I processor project.

## RISC-V Verification Environment Setup

### Toolchain Installation
- **RISC-V GNU Toolchain**: Installed at ` /work/riscv-tools/` with RV32I target at WSL
- **Spike ISS**: Built and verified for RV32I instruction simulation
- **Proxy Kernel (pk)**: Configured with `rv32i_zicsr_zifencei` architecture
- **RISC-V DV**: Installed in Python virtual environment for test generation

### Test Program Development
Created and verified three test programs:
1. `count.c` - Basic counting loop
2. `multiply.c` - Factorial calculation with printf
3. `complex_test.c` - Algorithm test suite

All programs successfully compile with RV32I toolchain and execute correctly in Spike simulator.

### Machine Code Generation
Generated multiple output formats for test programs:
- Intel HEX (`.hex`)
- Verilog Memory (`.mem`)
- Raw Binary (`.bin`)
- Motorola S-Record (`.srec`)

### Documentation
- Created assembly analysis document (`multiply_analysis.txt`)
- Developed verification tools cheat sheet (`riscv_verification_cheatsheet.tex`)

## SystemVerilog Pipeline Refactoring

### Completed Integration
Integrated pipeline registers directly into stage modules to improve architecture clarity:

1. **IF/ID Register**: Integrated into `fetch_stage.sv`
   - Added clock, reset, and flush logic
   - Outputs: instruction, immediate, PC+4, branch prediction

2. **ID/EX Register**: Integrated into `decode_stage.sv`
   - Added pipeline control signals
   - Outputs: register data, control signals, branch selection

### Modified Files
- `digital/modules/fetch_stage/src/fetch_stage.sv`
- `digital/modules/decode_stage/src/decode_stage.sv`
- `digital/modules/digital_top/src/rv32i_core.sv`

### Pending Work
- EX/MEM pipeline register integration in `execute_stage.sv`
- MEM/WB pipeline register integration in `mem_stage.sv`

## Verification Status

### Current Capabilities
- Cross-compilation from C to RISC-V assembly/machine code
- Full program simulation with system call support
- Interactive debugging and instruction trace analysis
- Multiple machine code format generation

### Test Coverage
Verified instruction types include arithmetic, logical, memory, control flow, and data movement operations.

## Next Steps
1. Complete remaining pipeline register integrations
2. Validate refactored design with existing testbenches
3. Integrate RISC-V DV for automated test generation
4. Perform comprehensive verification of processor design
