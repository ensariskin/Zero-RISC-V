### Key Files to Monitor During Development

#### Phase 1 Files:
- `digital/modules/fetch_stage_super/src/multi_fetch_unit.sv`
- `digital/modules/decode_stage_super/src/multi_decode_unit.sv`
- `digital/modules/branch_predictor_super/src/branch_predictor_top.sv`

#### Phase 2 Files:
- `digital/modules/register_renaming/src/rename_unit_top.sv`
- `digital/modules/reservation_stations/src/reservation_station.sv`
- `digital/modules/execution_units/src/execution_arbiter.sv`

#### Phase 3 Files:
- `digital/modules/reorder_buffer/src/reorder_buffer.sv`
- `digital/modules/load_store_queue/src/lsq_top.sv`
- `digital/modules/superscalar_top/src/superscalar_core.sv`

## Performance Targets by Phase

### Phase 1 Targets:
- **IPC**: 1.0-1.2 (improved fetch bandwidth)
- **Branch Accuracy**: >85% (improved from ~70%)
- **Frequency**: Maintain current frequency

### Phase 2 Targets:  
- **IPC**: 1.2-1.5 (reduced false dependencies)
- **Pipeline Efficiency**: >80% utilization
- **Register Pressure**: Significantly reduced

### Phase 3 Targets:
- **IPC**: 1.5-2.0 (multiple execution units)

- **Alternative**: Optimize existing components before proceeding

### Week 8 Decision: Renaming Effectiveness  
- **Go/No-Go**: Register renaming reducing dependencies?
- **Alternative**: Simplify renaming algorithm if complex

### Week 12 Decision: Execution Scaling
- **Go/No-Go**: Multiple units improving performance?
- **Alternative**: Focus on single-unit optimization

### Week 16 Decision: Overall Success
- **Go/No-Go**: Meeting performance targets?
- **Action**: Merge to superscalar-clean branch

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Risks:
1. **Complexity Management**: Keep modules small and focused
2. **Timing Issues**: Regular synthesis and timing analysis
3. **Verification**: Extensive testbench development

### Schedule Risks:
1. **Slip Prevention**: Weekly milestone reviews
2. **Scope Management**: Feature prioritization matrix
3. **Resource Planning**: Parallel development where possible

This roadmap provides a practical, week-by-week guide for implementing the superscalar processor conversion while maintaining development momentum and deliverable quality.
