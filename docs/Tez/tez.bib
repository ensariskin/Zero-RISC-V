abstract = {Space Cyber-Physical Systems such as spacecraft and satellites strongly rely on the reliability of onboard computers to guarantee the success of their missions. Relying solely on radiation-hardened technologies is extremely expensive, and developing inflexible architectural and microarchitectural modifications to introduce modular redundancy within a system leads to significant area increase and performance degradation. To mitigate the overheads of traditional radiation hardening and modular redundancy approaches, we present a novel Hybrid Modular Redundancy approach, a redundancy scheme that features a cluster of RISC-V processors with a flexible on-demand dual-core and triple-core lockstep grouping of computing cores with runtime split-lock capabilities. Further, we propose two recovery approaches, software-based and hardware-based, trading off performance and area overhead. Running at 430 MHz, our fault-tolerant cluster achieves up to 1,160 MOPS on a matrix multiplication benchmark when configured in non-redundant mode and 617 and 414 MOPS in dual and triple mode, respectively. A software-based recovery in triple mode requires 363 clock cycles and occupies 0.612 mm2, representing a 1.3\% area overhead over a non-redundant 12-core RISC-V cluster. As a high-performance alternative, a new hardware-based method provides rapid fault recovery in just 24 clock cycles and occupies 0.660 mm2, namely, ∼9.4\% area overhead over the baseline non-redundant RISC-V cluster. The cluster is also enhanced with split-lock capabilities to enter one of the available redundant modes with minimum performance loss, allowing execution of a mission-critical portion of code when in independent mode, or a performance section when in a reliability mode, with <400 clock cycles overhead for entry and exit. The proposed system is the first to integrate these functionalities on an open-source RISC-V-based compute device, enabling finely tunable reliability versus performance trade-offs.},

abstract="Reliable Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) must ensure their functionality according to the criticality level of their application, even under Single Event Transients (SETs) and Single Event Upsets (SEUs) caused by ionizing radiations. Dual (DCLS) and Triple Core Lockstep (TCLS) are typical radiation-hardening techniques for processors based on spatial redundancy. However, these approaches can be costly when embedding computing platforms into dependable systems with constrained area and budget requirements. We propose a low-cost fault mitigation technique targeted at SETs called Temporal Lockstep (TL), which combines temporal redundancy and minimal spatial repetition to reduce the area overhead with respect to state-of-the-art solutions. TL was implemented on the open-source Ibex core and synthesized in GF 22 nm technology. The area overhead ranges from 53{\%} to 77{\%}, significantly lower than the over 100{\%} and 200{\%} seen in DCLS and TCLS, respectively. Fault injection simulations show an 82.8{\%} reduction in faulty execution outcomes thanks to Temporal Lockstep.",

ABSTRACT = {Recent research has shown interest in adopting the RISC-V processors for high-reliability electronics, such as aerospace applications. The openness of this architecture enables the implementation and customization of the processor features to increase their reliability. Studies on hardened RISC-V processors facing harsh radiation environments apply fault tolerance techniques in the processor core and peripherals, exploiting system redundancies. In prior work, we present a hardened RISC-V System-on-Chip (SoC), which could detect and correct radiation-induced faults with limited fault awareness. Therefore, in this work, we propose solutions to extend the fault observability of the SoC implementation by providing error detection and monitoring. For this purpose, we introduce observation features in the redundant structures of the system, enabling the report of valuable information that supports enhanced radiation testing and support the application to perform actions to recover from critical failures. Thus, the main contribution of this work is a solution to improve fault awareness and the analysis of the fault models in the system. In order to validate this solution, we performed complementary experiments in two irradiation facilities, comprehending atmospheric neutrons and a mixed-field environment, in which the system proved to be valuable for analyzing the radiation effects on the processor core and its peripherals. In these experiments, we were able to obtain a range of error reports that allowed us to gain a deeper understanding of the faults mechanisms, as well as improve the characterization of the SoC.},
